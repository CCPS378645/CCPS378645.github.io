    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1.  Something I am working towards In my professional life Is to be a Hard working, smart, and kind/ generous man. I wish to be able to provide to other that are in need because I know the struggles of having to start with nothing while everyone around you is given a head start. I want to be able to help those that started off like me.

2. I am working towards my goals by focusing on myself and keeping myself in line. I always want to be better then before, I work on my skills and hone then to there fullest. The skills I have developed over the years will be key to my upbringing. 

3. Some values I consider necessary for my success are to always have a positive outlook on things even if things aren't going my way. Also to able to support people with there problems even if that means I have to postpone my work. The thing I value most to my future of successes is my ability to talk to others, what I mean by this is to understand where one is coming from and be able to assist them with what ever they may need because I strive to be the best version of myself possible.

4. Some short term goals I want to achieve in the near future would be to learn a new language and be financially stable. These are just some goals I want to achieve in about a year or two. I will continue to better myself while achieving these goals.

5.The character traits i want to be known for are my kindness and how easily I am to approach. I want to be loved by everyone I meet. It hurts my soul when i know that someone has something bad to say about me or just dislikes me, i want to be liked by everyone.</p>
